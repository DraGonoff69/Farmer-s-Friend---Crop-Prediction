Welcome to Farmer Friend!
At Farmer Friend, we understand the challenges faced by farmers in making informed decisions about their crops. That's why we have created a user-friendly website that combines the power of HTML, CSS, React, and Chat GPT API to provide accurate crop predictions and valuable farming information.

The website is designed with a clean and intuitive layout to ensure a seamless user experience. Upon landing on the homepage, visitors are greeted with a visually appealing interface that highlights the key features and benefits of Farmer Friend. The color scheme is carefully chosen to evoke a sense of nature and agriculture, with shades of green and earthy tones.

One of the standout features of Farmer Friend is the Crop Prediction section, which utilizes the power of React. This section allows farmers to input relevant data, such as soil type, region, temperature etc, into a user-friendly form. The form is intelligently designed to capture all the necessary information without overwhelming the user.

Once the data is submitted, our website leverages the Chat GPT API to provide accurate and insightful crop predictions. Chat GPT, a state-of-the-art language model, analyzes the input data and generates comprehensive reports on the most suitable crops for the given conditions. The predictions are displayed in an easy-to-read format, with detailed information about each recommended crop's characteristics, growth cycle, and potential yield.

We take pride in the accuracy and reliability of our predictions, and we are committed to continuously improving the Farmer Friend platform. We understand the importance of timely and accurate information for farmers, and our goal is to empower them with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions and maximize their crop yields.

Join Farmer Friend today and experience the power of HTML, CSS, React, and Chat GPT API in revolutionizing your farming practices. Together, let's grow a sustainable future for agriculture!

Now, project is ready to go

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
